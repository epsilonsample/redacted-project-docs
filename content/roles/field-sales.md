## Mobile-Specific Features

When using the mobile app, some features work differently:

=== "Sorting"

    On mobile, use the **Sort Order** button instead of column headers:
    
    1. Tap **Sort Order**
    2. Choose your preferred sort options.
    3. Tap **Sort** or **Sort and Save Sort Order**.

=== "Filtering"

    Mobile uses simplified filtering:
    
    - Only **EBILLING** and **SALES PERSON** filters are available.
    - No column-specific filters
